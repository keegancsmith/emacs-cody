  "Macro to define Cody document synchronization tests for Buttercup.

ARGS is a plist containing the keys:
  :before - the initial content of the buffer.
  :after - the expected content of the buffer after transformation.
  :code - the code to run to perform the transformation.
  :point-char (optional) - the character in :before text marking
                           the cursor position. Default is ?^
  :mark-char (optional) - the character in :before text marking the
                          mark position. Default is ?$

The general test strategy is to run a transformation, await promises, and then
fetch the agent's copy of the content and compare it."
