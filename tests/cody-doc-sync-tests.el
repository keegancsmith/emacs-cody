;;; cody-doc-sync-tests.el --- Tests for Cody document synchronization -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Document synchronization tests, to validate that Agent is tracking the
;; selection and buffer content of Cody-enabled buffers.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'buttercup)
(require 'cody)
(require 'cody-test-fixture)

;; To run these tests:
;;   cd .. && eask run buttercup
;; or:
;;   M-x buttercup-run-at-point on this sexpr:
;;
;; To skip a test:
;;   - insert (buttercup-skip "reason") at the top, after the it-clause.
